# What was CTFAK 2.0?
CTFAK 2.0 (Standing for **C**lick**T**eam **F**usion **A**rmy **K**nife **2.0**) was a tool developed by Kostya with help from Yunivers which can be used to either decompile or dump assets of games made with the Clickteam Fusion 2.5 game engine.

With CTFAK 2.0's plugin system, it was easy for anyone to make a plugin compatible with CTFAK 2.0 which allows you to do anything with the data read by CTFAK 2.0 including, but not limited to, converting the data to other game engines, programming your own dumping method to suit however you want to organize your data, or messing with the outputted data by modifying the `FTDecompile` plugin.

CTFAK 2.0 was split between 2 branches; the [master](https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0/tree/master) branch and the [2.3](https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0/tree/CTFAK-2.3) branch.<br/>
CTFAK 2.3 is more unstable than CTFAK 2.2, thus this README will only be referring to the 'master' branch, also known as CTFAK 2.2, which is the recommended version.

# Installation
## Dependencies
CTFAK 2.0 required [.NET 6.0's Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).

After running the x64 installer, you may proceed with the installation.
## Installing a precompiled artifact

To install an artifact, you must be logged into a Github account, then you must make your way over to [Actions](https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0/actions?query=branch%3Amaster), and from there select the latest workflow **marked with the word `master`**. On that page, if you scroll down you should find `Artifacts`, from there just click on `CTFAK` and it will start downloading.

> [!NOTE]  
> As actions expire after a while, you may need to compile CTFAK yourself. See [Compilation](https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0#compilation)

Once it's downloaded, extract the .zip file to an empty folder, and then in those contents, extract `ctfakrequirements.zip` into the same folder it's found in.

To know you've extracted it properly, `template.mfa` should be found in the same folder as `CTFAK.Cli.exe`.

# Compilation
## Dependencies
CTFAK 2.0 required [.NET 6.0's Desktop Runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0).

After running the x64 installer, you may proceed with the compilation.

## Cloning the repo with Visual Studio 2022

Make sure you have [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/) installed and open.

On the GitHub branch, click `Code` and copy the HTTPS URL.

In Visual Studio 2022, under `Get started`, click `Clone a repository`, then paste the HTTPS URL from earlier. Input your desired path and press `Clone`.

## Compiling CTFAK 2.0

**Compiling CTFAK usually was not recommended.** Please go to [installation](https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0#installation) to download CTFAK precompiled if possible.

Compiling CTFAK would not get you newer features compared to the actions.

If you'd like to compile CTFAK anyway, right click the solution on the right and press `Build Solution` or do it through the key bind `Control + Shift + B`, then right click the solution once again and press `Open Folder in File Explorer`.

In the File Explorer go to `Interface\CTFAK.Cli\bin\Debug\net6.0-windows` and create a folder called `Plugins`, then go back to the solution folder and browse into `Plugins` and in both `CTFAK.Decompiler` and `Dumper`, browse to `bin\Debug\net6.0-windows`, and copy `CTFAK.Decompiler.dll`, `CTFAK.Decompiler.pdb`, `Dumper.dll`, and `Dumper.pdb` then paste them into the `Plugins` folder you created earlier.

Finally, download [ctfakrequirements.zip](https://github.com/CTFAK/.github/raw/main/ctfakrequirements.zip) and extract the contents into the same folder you created `Plugins` in. To know you've extracted it properly, `template.mfa` should be found in the same folder as `CTFAK.Cli.exe`.

Now, you should be able to run `CTFAK.Cli.exe` without problems!

# Usage
CTFAK 2.0 was very easy to use and required little input from the user.

To get started, open `CTFAK.Cli.exe` and drag in your Clickteam Fusion 2.5 exe, apk, ccn, dat, bin, or mfa file and press enter.

In parameters, you could input anything listed in [Parameters](https://github.com/CTFAK/CTFAK2.0#parameters), but make sure to put a `-` before each one. If you don't want to input any parameters (which you normally shouldn't need to do) then you can leave it blank. After you've filled out your parameters, press enter.

If you're using a `.ccn`, `.dat`, or `.bin` file it would bring up a prompt asking you to select a file reader. In any case, select CCN.

If all goes according to plan, you should see a screen saying `Reading finished in _ seconds` along with some information about the game. From here you may run any plugins you have installed. Normal installations should have `Export as MFA`, `Dump Everything`, `Image Dumper`, `Sound Dumper`, `Packed Data Dumper`, and `Sorted Image Dumper`.

> [!WARNING]  
> Please do not report any issues. CTFAK 2.0 is no longer being worked on. Please do not bother us about it.

Finally, you may close CTFAK 2.0 and find any outputs your plugins gave, in the `Dumps` folder.
